I have built a website where user can enter the X and Y coordinates of origin and click on Submit button. On Submit, a list of 26 coordinates in order of closest-to-farthest from the origin is displayed on the same page.   Instructions:  1. The part1 folder after has to be imported in a JavaScript IDE such as Web Storm. 2. Load “coordinates.index.html” file in browser. 2.Enter the X and Y coordinates. 3.Click Submit button. 4.The Ordered list is displayed
